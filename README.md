# portfolio
this is where i show you guys/girls what i can do as an developer:) havnt done that many projects yet, so its quit empty for now

# the portifolio
is made with plain html, css and Javascipt, its mostly html and css. the only thing i used js for was the smoothscrolling and the dark mode toggle.
its a one-Page_site (OPS) with easy to use Smooth scrolling, so when u click on a section ui wanna go to, it takes u there without u having to scroll,
i have added hower effects and some other effects on the images and on the cards, to make the site a bit more interactive, i might add more later.



# Contribution
- *since this is my prrtifolio, i do not want any contribution.
