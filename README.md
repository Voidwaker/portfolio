# Portfolio

This portfolio is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project primarily focuses on HTML and CSS, with JavaScript used solely for smooth scrolling and a dark mode toggle. It is designed as a one-page site (OPS) featuring intuitive smooth scrolling – simply click on a section, and you'll be taken there without manual scrolling. I’ve also added hover effects and other interactive animations on images and cards to enhance the user experience. More features might be added in the future.

## Contribution

Since this is my personal portfolio, I am not accepting contributions at this time.
